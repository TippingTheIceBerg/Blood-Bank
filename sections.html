        <h1>Procedures</h1>
        <h2 id="RedCellSuspension">Red cell suspension</h2>
        <p> A red cell suspension requires you to wash your red cells, this is done by filling a tube with some, some being just a squirt of some red cells, and then filling the tube to about 3/4 of the tube height with saline. The tube will then be spun for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Pour off the saline, your red cells are now ready to be made into your 3 - 4 % cel suspension. How much saline you add depends on how much red cells you added, which is typically 1/3 of the height of the tube. Compare to the cell suspension of the screen cells. </p>
        <h2 id="TypeAndScreen">What is a Type and Screen?</h2>
        <p>Type and Screen are the most common type of blood bank orders. A forward and reverse typing are done for the blood type of the patient and this is the <strong>TYPE</strong> portion of the order. A <strong>SCREEN</strong> is the use of screen cells in order to ID if any antibodies are present in the patient.</p>
        <h2 id="ForwardReverseTyping">How to perform a forward and reverse typing</h2>
        <p>A forward typing is done with 1 drop of antibodies A1 and B with one drop of patient 3-4% <a href="#RedCellSuspension">red cell suspension</a>.A reverse typing is when two drops of patient serum and one drop of commercial A and B cells are put in a tube. Samples are spun to IS(Immediate Spin).</p>
        <h2 id="ScreenCells">Screen Cells</h2>
        <p>Screen cells are used when we want to check if the patient has any antibodies in the serum. Like reverse typing,this uses two drops of patient serum and one drop of red cells, in this case they are screen cells 1 - 3. The main difference is that these are done at IS and then move to AHG.</p>
        <h2 id="AHG">What is AHG?</h2>
        <p>Moving cells to AHG requires your sample to have been giving 2 drops of PEG after being read at IS,and then incubated for 15 - 30 minutes. After incubation, these cells are washed 4 times in a cell washer or manually and then 2 drops of monoclonal IgG is dropped into the tubes. The cells are spun for 25 seconds, the same setting as an IS spin,then read both macroscopically and microscopically.</p>
        <h2 id="RH">Rh</h2>
        <p>Rh typing is typically done with the forward typing and requires one drop of patient cell suspension to 1 drop of commercial antiserum D.</p>
