        <p class="about__paragraph">As you come across learning you might have told yourself, "self, blood bank is all too important to have a cheat sheet, you should approach this with memorizing everything!". And that's not wrong, Blood Bank is incredibly important with the sheer purpose of keeping patients alive. However, we are also human, and as new learners come and go, we need to understand that with starting out, we need quick refreshers and tips to common questions without the need of pausing what we're doing for too long or waiting for an answer back from someone. We need quick,reliable, and well organized answers and this site accomplishes that.</p>
